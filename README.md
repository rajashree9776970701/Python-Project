# Python-Project
A Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python typically uses a list to represent the 3x3 game board, where each element in the list corresponds to a cell on the board (empty initially), and players take turns marking their symbol ('X' or 'O') in a chosen cell; the game ends when one player aligns three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or when all cells are filled without a winner (a tie); key functions include displaying the board, taking player input to choose a cell, checking for winning combinations after each move, and switching turns between players. 
Key elements of a Python Tic Tac Toe game:
Board representation: A list with 9 elements, where each element represents a cell on the board (usually initialized with empty spaces). 
Player symbols: Two variables representing the player symbols, typically 'X' and 'O'. 
Turn management: A variable to keep track of the current player's turn, switching between players after each move. 
Input handling: Function to take player input (which cell to mark) and validate the input to ensure it's a valid cell on the board. 
Display board function: A function to neatly print the game board on the console, showing the current state of the cells. 
Win condition check: A function to check if any player has won by analyzing all possible winning combinations (horizontal, vertical, diagonals). 
Tie condition check: A function to check if all cells are filled without a winner.
